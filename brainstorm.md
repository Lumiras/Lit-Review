#Brainstorm

Approaching the narrative aspects of games is, I believe, the most important. Establishing mechanics is inherit to games...without mechanics, they're not games, even if those mechanics are simply a player making choices

Using Espen Aarseth's definition of Ergodic Literature, considering all games that try to convey a narrative as ergodic works, I will then further isolate the realm of games by looking only at games that would fall under Jesper Juul's classification of games of progression.

From here, look at how games that fall under this criteria attempt to convey their stories to the player, and how the introduction of mechanics and the complications such mechanics bring to a narrative can aid or hinder in the telling of a story.

Isolate to games whose primary goal is to tell a story? How do I identify the intent of the authors?

Games to examine here would be *Gone Home*, *Firewatch*, *Her Story*, *Everyone's Gone to the Rapture*, *Cibele*, *Soma*, *Amnesia*, *Dear Esther*,
